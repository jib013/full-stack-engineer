registration-timeline

Hereâ€™s how our registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.

Race number:

    Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
    All others receive a number below 1000.

Start time:

    Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
        Early adults run at 9:30 am.
        Late adults run at 11:00 am.
    Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).

let raceNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);
console.log(raceNumber);

//is registered or not
let registeredEarly = true;

//runner's age
let age = 18;

//Create a control flow statement that checks whether the runner is an adult AND registered early. add 1000 to the race number if it's true (adults have numbers 1000+)
if (registeredEarly === true && age > 18) {
  raceNumber += 1000;
}

//assigns race number for registrant
if (registeredEarly === true && age > 18) {
  console.log(`Your race number is: ${raceNumber}. Your start time is 9:30 AM.`)
} else if (registeredEarly !== true && age > 18) {
  console.log(`Your race number is: ${raceNumber}. Your starting time is 11:00 AM.`);
} else if (age < 18) {
  console.log(`Your race number is: ${raceNumber}. Your starting time is 12:30 PM.`);
} else {
  console.log(`Because you are exactly 18, please check in with the registration desk.`);
