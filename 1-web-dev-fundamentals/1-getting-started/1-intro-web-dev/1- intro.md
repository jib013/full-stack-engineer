Introduction: Overview of Web Development

See what you’ll be learning in the Overview of Web Development Unit.

The goal of this unit is to introduce you to the field of web development software engineering before diving into the technical parts of the track.

After this unit, you will be able to:

    Describe on a broad level how the internet works
    Identify different languages used for web development
    Define what programming is
    Summarize what a software engineer does in their job
    Explain the difference between front-end and back-end engineering (and full-stack!)

Learning is social. Whatever you’re working on, be sure to connect with the Codecademy community in the forums. Remember to check in with the community regularly, including for things like asking for code reviews on your project work and providing code reviews to others in the projects category, which can help to reinforce what you’ve learned.


Review

Congratulations! You should now have a general understanding of how the internet works, including:

    The growth of the internet as a network
    The difference between the internet and the world wide web
    The relationship between browsers and servers
    HTTP status codes, like 404 Not Found
    Big trends in web development, from static websites to Web 2.0 and the rise of mobile

If you work with engineers, this information will help you talk about websites and web applications at a more technical level. Or if you’re interested in becoming a web developer yourself, you now have the important context to start building your own website or web application!
