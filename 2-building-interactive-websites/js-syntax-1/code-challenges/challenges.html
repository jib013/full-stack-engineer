    <p>Write a function, greetWorld(). Your function should have no parameters and return the string 'Hello, World!'.
    </p>
    <script>
        const greetWorld = () => 'Hello, World!';
    </script>

    <p>The most common minimum age to vote is 18. Write a function canIVote() that takes in a number, representing the
        person’s age, and returns the boolean true if they are 18 years old or older, and the boolean false if they are
        not.</p>
    <script>
        const canIVote = number => {
            if (number >= 18) {
                return true;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
        console.log(canIVote(19)) // Should print true
    </script>

    <p>Write a function, agreeOrDisagree(), that takes in two strings, and returns 'You agree!' if the two strings are
        the same and 'You disagree!' if the two strings are different.</p>
    <script>
        const agreeOrDisagree = (string1, string2) => {
            if (string1 === string2) {
                return 'You agree!';
            } else {
                return 'You disagree!';
            }
        }

        console.log(agreeOrDisagree("yep", "yep"))
        // Should print 'You agree!'
    </script>

    <p>Write a function, lifePhase(), that takes in a person’s age, as a number, and returns which phase of life they
        are in.<br><br>

        Here are the classifications:
        0-3 should return 'baby'
        4-12 should return 'child'
        13-19 should return 'teen'
        20-64 should return 'adult'
        65-140 should return 'senior citizen'
        If the number is less than 0 or greater than 140, the program should return 'This is not a valid age'</p>
    <p>Note: this funciton will fail unless it checks age numerically. Checking if age is < 0 or> 140 at the end throws
            an error.</p>
    <script>
        // Write your function here:
        const lifePhase = age => {
            if (age < 0 || age > 140) {
                return 'This is not a valid age';
            } else if (age >= 0 && age <= 3) {
                return 'baby';
            } else if (age >= 4 && age <= 12) {
                return 'child';
            } else if (age >= 13 && age <= 19) {
                return 'teen';
            } else if (age >= 20 && age <= 64) {
                return 'adult';
            } else if (age >= 65 && age <= 140) {
                return 'senior citizen';
            } else if (age < 0) {
                return 'This is not a valid age';
            }
        };


        // Uncomment the line below when you're ready to try out your function
        console.log(lifePhase(5)) //should print 'child'

        // We encourage you to add more function calls of your own to test your code!

    <p>Write a function, finalGrade(). It should:<br><br>

        take three arguments of type number<br>
        find the average of those three numbers<br>
        return the letter grade (as a string) that the average corresponds to
        return ‘You have entered an invalid grade.’ if any of the three grades are less than 0 or greater than 100<br>
        0-59 should return: 'F'<br>
        60-69 should return: 'D'<br>
        70-79 should return: 'C'<br>
        80-89 should return: 'B'<br>
        90-100 should return: 'A'</p>
    <script>
        // Write your function here:
        const finalGrade = (num1, num2, num3) => {
            if (num1 < 0 || num1 > 100 || num2 < 0 || num2 > 100 || num3 < 0 || num3 > 100) {
                return 'You have entered an invalid grade.';
            }

            let average = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3;

            if (average >= 0 && average <= 59) {
                return 'F';
            } else if (average >= 60 && average <= 69) {
                return 'D';
            } else if (average >= 70 && average <= 79) {
                return 'C';
            } else if (average >= 80 && average <= 89) {
                return 'B';
            } else if (average >= 90 && average <= 100) {
                return 'A';
            } else {
                return 'You have entered an invalid grade.';
            }
        }





        // Uncomment the line below when you're ready to try out your function
        console.log(finalGrade(99, 92, 95)) // Should print 'A'

    <p></p>
    <script>
        // Write your function here:
        const reportingForDuty = (rank, lastName) => {
            return `${rank} ${lastName} reporting for duty!`;
        }


        // Uncomment the line below when you're ready to try out your function

    <p>We wrote a function, rollTheDice(), which is supposed to simulate two dice being rolled and totalled. It’s close
        to doing what we want, but there’s something not quite right. Can you fix our code, please?</p>
    <script>
        const rollTheDice = () => {
            // Math.random() gives us a random number from 0 up to, but not including, 1
            // We multiplied that by 6 to get a number between 0 and up to, but not including, 6
            // But since we actually wanted numbers from 1 to 6, inclusive, we added 1
            let die1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1
            let die2 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1
            //added console logs to check values. Needed to add Math.floor() above to round down. 
            console.log(die1);
            console.log(die2);
            return die1 + die2
        }

        rollTheDice(1, 1);
    </script>

    <p>Though an object’s mass remains consistent throughout the universe, weight is determined by the force of gravity
        on an object. Since different planets have different gravity, the same object would weigh different amounts on
        each of those planets! Cool, huh?<br><br>

        Write a function, calculateWeight(). It should:<br><br>

        have two parameters: earthWeight and planet<br>
        expect earthWeight to be a number<br>
        expect planet to be a string<br>
        return a number representing what that Earth-weight would equate to on the planet passed in.<br><br>
        Handle the following cases:<br>
        'Mercury' weight = earthWeight * 0.378<br>
        'Venus' weight = earthWeight * 0.907<br>
        'Mars' weight = earthWeight * 0.377<br>
        'Jupiter' weight = earthWeight * 2.36<br>
        'Saturn' weight = earthWeight * 0.916<br>
        For all other inputs, return 'Invalid Planet Entry. Try: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, or Saturn.'</p>
    <script>
        //note: my issues were that I needed to remove "*=" and just use "*". 

        // Write your function here:
        const calculateWeight = (earthWeight, planet) => {
            switch (planet) {
                case 'Mercury':
                    return earthWeight * .378;
                case 'Venus':
                    return earthWeight * .907;
                case 'Mars':
                    return earthWeight * .377;
                case 'Jupiter':
                    return earthWeight * 2.36;
                case 'Saturn':
                    return earthWeight * .916;
                default:
                    return 'Invalid Planet Entry. Try: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, or Saturn.';
            }
        };

        // Uncomment the line below when you're ready to try out your function
        console.log(calculateWeight(100, 'Jupiter')) // Should print 236

    </script>

    <p>
        It can be hard to keep track of what’s truthy or falsy in JavaScript. Write a function, truthyOrFalsy(), that
        takes in any value and returns true if that value is truthy and false if that value is falsy.</p>
    <script>
        // Write your function here:
        const truthyOrFalsy = value => {
            if (value) {
                return true;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        };

        // Uncomment the line below when you're ready to try out your function
        console.log(truthyOrFalsy(0)) // Should print false

        // We encourage you to add more function calls of your own to test your code!
    </script>

    <p>A person’s number of imaginary friends are always 25% (or 1/4) of their total friends.

        Write a function, numImaginaryFriends(), that takes in the total number of friends a person has and returns the
        number of imaginary friends they have.

        Since friends can only come in whole numbers, be sure to round your result up to the nearest whole number before
        returning it.

        The JavaScript Math.ceil() function will come in handy. Check out the documentation here to figure out how it
        works.</p>
    <script>
        // Write your function here:
        const numImaginaryFriends = (num) => {
            return Math.ceil(num * .25);
        }

        // Uncomment the lines below when you're ready to try out your function
        console.log(numImaginaryFriends(20)) // Should print 5
        console.log(numImaginaryFriends(10)) // Should print 3 (2.5 rounded up!)

        // We encourage you to add more function calls of your own to test your code!
    </script>

    <p>Write a function, sillySentence(), that has 3 string parameters and returns the following silly sentence with the
        blanks filled in by the arguments passed into the function:</p>
    <script>
        // Write your function here:

        const sillySentence = (adj, verb, noun) => {
            return `I am so ${adj} because I ${verb} coding! Time to write some more awesome ${noun}!`;
        }

        // Uncomment the line below when you're ready to try out your function
        console.log(sillySentence('excited', 'love', 'functions'))

        // We encourage you to add more function calls of your own to test your code!

        //my attempt

        // Write your function here:

            let calcAge = year - currYear;
            let futureDif = calcAge + age;

            //current currYear - year entered
            let pastAge = currYear - year;

        console.log(howOldMine(35, 1990));
        // Once your function is written, write function calls to test your code!

    <p>Given the percentage of DNA shared between two people, you can calculate their likely familial relationship.

        We wrote a function, whatRelation(), that has one number parameter, percentSharedDNA, and returns the likely
        relationship. We expect the number passed in to always be an integer from 0 to 100, but for some reason it’s not
        working!

        Here’s how it’s supposed to calculate the relationship:

        100 should return 'You are likely identical twins.'
        35-99 should return 'You are likely parent and child or full siblings.'
        14-34 should return 'You are likely grandparent and grandchild, aunt/uncle and niece/nephew, or half siblings.'
        6-13 should return 'You are likely 1st cousins.'
        3-5 should return 'You are likely 2nd cousins.'
        1-2 should return 'You are likely 3rd cousins.'
        0 should return 'You are likely not related.'</p>
    <script>
        const whatRelation = percentSharedDNA => {
            if (percentSharedDNA === 100) {
                return 'You are likely identical twins.'
            }
            if (percentSharedDNA > 34) {
                return 'You are likely parent and child or full siblings.'
            }
            if (percentSharedDNA < 35 && percentSharedDNA > 13) {
                return 'You are likely grandparent and grandchild, aunt/uncle and niece/nephew, or half siblings.'
            }
            if (percentSharedDNA > 5 && percentSharedDNA < 14) {
                return 'You are likely !st cousins.'
            }
            if (percentSharedDNA >= 3 && percentSharedDNA <= 5) {
                return 'You are likely 2nd cousins.'
            }
            if (percentSharedDNA == 1 || percentSharedDNA == 2) {
                return 'You are likely 3rd cousins'
            }
            return 'You are likely not related.'
        }

        console.log(whatRelation(34))
        // Should print 'You are likely grandparent and grandchild, aunt/uncle and niece/nephew, or half siblings.'

        console.log(whatRelation(3))
        // Should print 'You are likely 2nd cousins.'
    </script>

    <p>Create a function, tipCalculator(), that has two parameters, a string representing the quality of the service
        received and a number representing the total cost.

        Return the tip, as a number, based on the following:
        ‘bad’ should return a 5% tip
        ‘ok’ should return a 15% tip
        ‘good’ should return a 20% tip
        ‘excellent’ should return a 30% tip
        all other inputs should default to 18%

        tipCalculator('good', 100) // Should return 20</p>
    <script>
        // Write your function here:
        const tipCalculator = (quality, total) => {
            if (quality === 'bad') {
                return total * .05;
            } else if (quality === 'ok') {
                return total * .15;
            } else if (quality === 'good') {
                return total * .20;
            } else if (quality === 'excellent') {
                return total * .30;
            } else {
                return total * .18;

        }


        // Uncomment the line below when you're ready to try out your function

    <p>Write a function, toEmoticon(), that takes in a string and returns the corresponding emoticon as a string. Use a
        switch/case, and cover these cases:

        'shrug' should return '|_{"}_|'
        'smiley face' should return ':)'
        'frowny face' should return':('
        'winky face' should return ';)'
        'heart' should return
