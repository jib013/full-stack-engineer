Font Weight

In CSS, the font-weight property controls how bold or thin text appears.

p {
  font-weight: bold;
}

In the example above, all paragraphs on the web page would appear bolded.

The font-weight property has another value: normal. Why does it exist?

If we wanted all text on a web page to appear bolded, we could select all text elements and change their font weight to bold. If a certain section of text was required to appear normal, however, we could set the font weight of that particular element to normal, essentially shutting off bold for that element.
