Visual Rules
Font Size

Changing the typeface isnâ€™t the only way to customize the text. Oftentimes, different sections of a web page are highlighted by modifying the font size.

To change the size of text on your web page, you can use the font-size property.

p {
  font-size: 18px;
}

In the example above, the font-size of all paragraphs was set to 18px. px means pixels, which is one way to measure font size.
