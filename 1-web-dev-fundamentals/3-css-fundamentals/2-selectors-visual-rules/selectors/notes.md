SELECTORS
Attributes

The most basic syntax is an attribute surrounded by square brackets. In the above example: [href] would target all elements with an href attribute and set the color to magenta.

And it can get more granular from there by adding type and/or attribute values. One way is by using type[attribute*=value]. In short, this code selects an element where the attribute contains any instance of the specified value. Letâ€™s take a look at an example.

<img src='/images/seasons/cold/winter.jpg'>
<img src='/images/seasons/warm/summer.jpg'>
The HTML code above renders two <img> elements, each containing a src attribute with a value equaling a link to an image file.

img[src*='winter'] {
  height: 50px;
}
 
img[src*='summer'] {
  height: 100px;
}
Now take a look at the above CSS code. The attribute selector is used to target each image individually.

The first ruleset looks for an img element with an attribute of src that contains the string 'winter', and sets the height to 50px.
The second ruleset looks for an img element with an attribute of src that contains the string 'summer', and sets the height to 100px.
Notice how no new HTML markup (like a class or id) needed to be added, and we were still able to modify the styles of each image independently. This is one advantage to using the attribute selector!
